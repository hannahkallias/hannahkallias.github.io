            <p>Hello! My name is Hannah Kallias and I am a freshman on the
                Weber State Womens Soccer team. My major is Computer Science.
                I was born in California, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah. 
                I also really enjoy hiking, drawing, and trail runs in my free time. 
                I am developing this portfolio website to primarily to showcase my JavaScript projects. </p>
